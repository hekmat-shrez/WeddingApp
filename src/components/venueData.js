        "DetailDescription": "The Great Hall is a wedding venue located in Toronto, Ontario. This property’s event spaces are the perfect marriage of grand and intimate, traditional and modern. To achieve this, original elements were painstakingly restored to their former glory during an ambitious 16-month restoration that covered every facet of the building. From the brick and Port Credit sandstone façade to the 19th-century radiators and original window mullions, attention was given to every detail in order to reveal The Great Hall’s rich history and ageless charm.\nFacilities and Capacity\nThe backbone of The Great Hall is its broad wooden staircase adorned with hand-carved, gilded ornaments. Design gems abound, including the original coffered hallway ceiling highlighted with crystal chandeliers, and practical features, like the all-new washrooms at each venue, exhibit old-world class paired with modern convenience. Secluded on the second floor, the Conversation Room is a classic Victorian “gathering place”. Crisp white walls reach up to a coffered ceiling surrounded by original hand-carved crown molding. Tasteful crystal chandeliers hang above the chevron pattern wood floor, but the stars of this bright, airy room are the large original windows, including a panoramic corner turret and seating nook. This is an idyllic romantic setting for your wedding ceremony, with a capacity of up to 110 guests. The facilities offered include the Main Hall, the historic centerpiece of the building.

The 5000 square foot space features sandstone brick walls that rise up to a patterned ceiling 20 feet above the polished concrete floor. The bar on each level is backed by slate and wood recovered from the restoration of The Great Hall’s peaked roof. Together, these elements combine to lend Longboat Hall a feel of industrial elegance.
